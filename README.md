# Cyber Breaches Dataset

This is a group project collaboration for INFO201 at the University of Washington. We are working with a dataset that contains different organizations that have been affected by cyber breaches from 2004 to 2017. The dataset contains information about how many records were lost from the cyber breach and how the breach occurred. We are using the dataset to create visualizations of cyber breaches and bring more awareness for the general audience about cyber breaches.
